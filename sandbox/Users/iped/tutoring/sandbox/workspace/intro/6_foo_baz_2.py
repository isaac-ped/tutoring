# Don't worry about this part for now:
from random import randint
my_variable = randint(0, 1000)

#
# Same as last time:
#
# Output to the console:
# "foo" if my_variable is divisible by 3
# "baz" if my_variable is divisible by 5
# and "foo-baz" if my_variable is divisible by both 3 and 5
#
# This time however, you are only allowed to use "==" twice!
# (hint: use booleans!)
